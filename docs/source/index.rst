The purpose of the code within this package is to simulate sports players/teams that compete against each other in a classic 1v1 elimination tournaments.
Originally the classes & code were created in support of another project but grew larger than expected and therefore large enough to become it own package.
At this point in time it is planned that the code shall continue to be developed.
