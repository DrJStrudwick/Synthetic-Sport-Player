# Synthetic-Sport-Player

Last updated - 10/3/2021

The purpose of the code within this package is to simulate sports players/teams that compete against each other in a classic 1v1 elimination tournaments.
Originally the classes & code were created in support of another project but grew larger than expected and therefore large enough to become it own package.
At this point in time it is planned that the code shall continue to be developed.

For the project homepage and issue tracking please see [the github repo.](https://github.com/DrJStrudwick/Synthetic-Sport-Player)

# Install & import
Install the project by running:
```
pip install synthSportPlayer-DJS
```
and import with:
```
import synthSportPlayer
```

There are 4 primary classes contained within this package:
1. `player` These are the teams/players that do the competeing. They are simply defined by a 'skill' level and a variance and whenever they have to 'compete' that is created from a normal distribution defined by these two properties.
2. `match` This is a match to handle two player competing where one will win and one will lose. The winner is determine by both players performing and the highest value wins. if they are equal then they
3. `tournament` This is an event that a collection of players enter and compete pair-wise with the winners moving forward to the next round, and is complete when there is one player remaining.
4. `season` This is a collection of tournaments that are played in order. at the end of the rounament the players recieve point based on how far they got in tha tournament.

There are two extra child classes that were written to extra both `tournament` and `season` to be able to have 'real-time' functionality for dashboarding purposes. They are:
1. `liveTourn`
2. `liveSeason`

The main difference is their respective `playTourn` and `playSeason` function. In the parent classes the functions would run to completition of the tournament/season. In these child classes they move forward one step in the current tournament.
